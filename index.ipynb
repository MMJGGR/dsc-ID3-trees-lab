You will write functions to calculate entropy and IG which will be used for calculating these uncertainty measures and deciding upon creating a split using information gain while growing an ID3 classification tree. You will also write a general function that can be used for other (larger) problems as well. So let's get on with it.\n","\n","## Objectives\n","\n","In this lab you will: \n","\n","- Write functions for calculating entropy and information gain measures  \n","- Use entropy and information gain to identify the attribute that results in the best split at each node\n","\n","\n","## Problem\n","\n","You will use the same problem about deciding whether to go and play tennis on a given day, given the weather conditions.
